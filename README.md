# Portal

This is finished implemantation of [portal-elixir](http://howistart.org/posts/elixir/1) by [@josevalim](https://github.com/josevalim).
It includes all original (tutrial) source code and additional exercises. You can follow commit history to see all next steps.

## Included?

- [x] Add a `Portal.push_left/1` function that transfers the data in the other direction. How can you avoid the code duplication existing between the `push_left/1` and `push_right/1` functions?
- [x] Learn more about [ExUnit](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/ex_unit/ExUnit.html), Elixir's testing framework, and write tests for the functionality we have built so far. Remember we already have a default structure laid out in the `test` directory
- [x] Generate HTML documentation for your project with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc).

**Read, copy, rewrite, LEARN.**
